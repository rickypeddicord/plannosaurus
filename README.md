### Orginize With Plannosaurus
Have you ever wanted to be more organized, but don’t want to lug around a big planner everywhere you go?  Plannosaurus is a completely customizable virtual planner that is perfect to help get you the organization you need. 

 

To make organization more enjoyable, we’ve included a variety of layouts that best suit you and fun stickers to make those important dates stand out!

 

The Plannosaurus is also a fully functioning app available on both iOS and Android.  That means you can access your own personalized planner right from your smartphone or device.  No more lugging around a planner!  This app combines the fun styles of physical planners and the calendar app on your phone to give you the best of both worlds!
